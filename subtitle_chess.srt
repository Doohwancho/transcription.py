1
00:00:07,512 --> 00:00:11,572
So we're 1665, pretty high

2
00:00:11,605 --> 00:00:15,022
rated. 1647 is our opponent. Let's go e

3
00:00:15,055 --> 00:00:18,607
four. And we're mostly still meeting. Okay, so c five.

4
00:00:18,685 --> 00:00:22,602
And we've been playing the smith mora with a lot of success in the speedrun.

5
00:00:22,632 --> 00:00:26,592
Let's continue that practice. And accepted smithmora.

6
00:00:26,652 --> 00:00:30,142
Let's go. Okay. E five. Now, I've actually

7
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:33,982
seen this move a lot at this level, which is new to me because,

8
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:38,187
I mean, it's a very anti positional move. It weakens the d five square tremendously.

9
00:00:38,262 --> 00:00:41,692
Black does sometimes play this move in the smith mora, but never this early.

10
00:00:41,815 --> 00:00:45,447
We want to develop our pieces normally, as we normally do in the smithmora.

11
00:00:45,492 --> 00:00:49,207
And we have massive control, we have total control over the square.

12
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:53,497
So we want to start by getting the bishop out to c

13
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:57,427
four. And we can also think about putting early pressure on

14
00:00:57,445 --> 00:01:00,727
the f seven pond. We can do that by getting the queen out to b

15
00:01:00,745 --> 00:01:03,877
three. I think everybody's familiar with this idea by now. When the pawn on c

16
00:01:03,895 --> 00:01:07,647
two is sacrificed early, queen b three related ideas

17
00:01:07,692 --> 00:01:11,077
become a thing. And speaking of which, queen b

18
00:01:11,095 --> 00:01:15,202
three here is very possible, but we could also amend that

19
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:19,132
in a slightly more tactical way. So what is possible

20
00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:21,275
here on the theme of queen b three?

21
00:01:23,987 --> 00:01:26,432
So we can start with the ship takes off. Stop, stop and check. There's a

22
00:01:26,435 --> 00:01:29,972
very interesting line there. After queen b three, check. Black can

23
00:01:30,005 --> 00:01:33,767
actually play d five using the tempo that he

24
00:01:33,815 --> 00:01:37,252
has while we're taking this bishop to shove

25
00:01:37,282 --> 00:01:40,952
this pawn down to d four. So the crazy thing

26
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:44,312
is that I actually think queen b three

27
00:01:44,375 --> 00:01:47,747
might be better than bishop takes f seven check in this

28
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:51,377
particular instance. So we're actually going to go queen b three. And after the

29
00:01:51,395 --> 00:01:54,977
game, I'll show you why I'm insistent on playing it

30
00:01:54,995 --> 00:01:58,897
this way. Now, which piece do we want to recapture with? Our opponent

31
00:01:58,942 --> 00:02:02,597
probably feels relieved that we didn't take on f seven, but I think that this

32
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:06,032
is much more likely to result in a quick win. But we definitely want

33
00:02:06,035 --> 00:02:09,107
to take with the pawn. We want to keep the battery alive and we want

34
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:12,692
to keep the pressure on f seven. In addition, taking with the pawn gives this

35
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:16,187
dark squared bishop a very, very powerful developing square

36
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:19,577
on a three. We could put the bishop there right now, but our

37
00:02:19,595 --> 00:02:22,592
opponent is left f seven hanging. We're definitely taking that.

38
00:02:22,715 --> 00:02:26,522
And I'm thinking that we could follow up by playing bishop. Bay three check.

39
00:02:26,705 --> 00:02:31,142
And this is going to get really dicey for black really,

40
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:34,697
really fast. Okay, so this is not GG yet,

41
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:38,037
by the way. This is not quite as easy as it may appear.

42
00:02:38,462 --> 00:02:42,422
As you'll see, black has a couple of defensive options. But I think if we

43
00:02:42,455 --> 00:02:45,997
develop properly, we should be close to winning. Let's start with bishop

44
00:02:46,042 --> 00:02:49,875
a three check. And then after d six, which is forced. Let's think.

45
00:02:50,687 --> 00:02:54,622
So the first option would be to put more pressure

46
00:02:54,667 --> 00:02:58,112
on the d six pond. This seems like a logical thing to do. So probably

47
00:02:58,175 --> 00:03:01,502
some of you are thinking, let's go rook d one. The problem with

48
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:04,575
rook d one is black has knight takes e four,

49
00:03:05,162 --> 00:03:09,197
simultaneously taking that pawn and then defending d

50
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:13,125
six. So we have to find a response to night takes c four.

51
00:03:14,012 --> 00:03:17,752
Now, I actually think that the response

52
00:03:17,782 --> 00:03:21,047
to night takes. Okay, there's an interesting line

53
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:24,452
there that I'm trying to puzzle out. So rookie one,

54
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:27,757
night 64 is one option. We could investigate that further.

55
00:03:27,922 --> 00:03:31,262
The other option is to simply develop

56
00:03:31,325 --> 00:03:34,862
our pieces. We could just play knight f three and castle and hold

57
00:03:34,925 --> 00:03:38,677
off on attacking the d six pawn until we're fully developed.

58
00:03:38,707 --> 00:03:41,857
But my intuition is telling me that rook

59
00:03:41,872 --> 00:03:45,647
d one has to be the move, and there has to be something. After 964,

60
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:49,652
we'll figure out what it is if black plays it. But I'm just

61
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:52,727
going to go rook d one intuitively, and then we'll cross that bridge if we

62
00:03:52,745 --> 00:03:56,312
get there. Okay, so we have gotten there,

63
00:03:56,450 --> 00:04:00,572
and this is, I think, an instructive moment because most people are

64
00:04:00,605 --> 00:04:03,722
probably thinking, let's get rid of this knight. So you're thinking of f three

65
00:04:03,755 --> 00:04:07,502
or queen d five. But neither of these moves seems as convincing to

66
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:10,892
me as perhaps it does to you because black will have

67
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:14,447
ways of counterattacking the f seven bishops. So, for example,

68
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:18,137
if white plays f three, black has the nasty move,

69
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:21,722
queen out to f six. And then if you calculate f

70
00:04:21,755 --> 00:04:24,675
takes e four, queen takes f seven.

71
00:04:25,412 --> 00:04:28,742
That is still a little bit uncertain, but in that

72
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:32,462
line, I actually think white is able to transform the position

73
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:36,257
into a very favorable end game. So f three is

74
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:40,247
one very viable option. Let's just go f three. Let's play this simple.

75
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:43,597
In an actual over the board game, I would very seriously

76
00:04:43,642 --> 00:04:47,417
consider playing night f three and just getting our pieces out,

77
00:04:47,465 --> 00:04:50,972
basically keeping the tension and then trying to castle. Okay,

78
00:04:51,005 --> 00:04:54,352
queen h four, check. I had a feeling that black would play this, but it's

79
00:04:54,382 --> 00:04:58,322
not good. We go g three. And if black takes on g three,

80
00:04:58,355 --> 00:05:01,277
then there's just checkmate on d six.

81
00:05:01,445 --> 00:05:04,697
So let's see if black is able to figure yeah, he is able to figure

82
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:07,922
out the best move, which is queen f six. And now I think that we

83
00:05:07,955 --> 00:05:11,250
have okay, so we've got a couple of options here.

84
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:16,142
This is not GG yet. I mean, black is somehow he's holding on,

85
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:19,957
which is pretty incredible. I think that we need to transform

86
00:05:20,047 --> 00:05:23,372
our advantage right now. We have this attack. What we need to do is

87
00:05:23,405 --> 00:05:26,312
just take the nine on e four and then take the pawn on d six,

88
00:05:26,375 --> 00:05:29,717
either with the rook or with the bishop. And we'll probably end up getting

89
00:05:29,765 --> 00:05:33,377
some sort of an end game where we're up upon and we have a

90
00:05:33,395 --> 00:05:37,327
tremendous initiative. So you got to be able to do that when you're attacking

91
00:05:37,357 --> 00:05:40,967
and say, okay, this form of the attack isn't working out

92
00:05:41,015 --> 00:05:44,537
exactly like I wanted it to. So we're going to take the attack and then

93
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:48,227
transform it into a different type of advantage. Now, how should

94
00:05:48,245 --> 00:05:51,602
we take on D six? We have two approaches here. The one hand, we could

95
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:55,322
take with the bishop and then collect Blacks pawns. We could play bishop takes

96
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:58,327
and then bishop takes C five. On the other hand, we could say, I don't

97
00:05:58,357 --> 00:06:01,772
care as much about the E five pond. I care more about the

98
00:06:01,805 --> 00:06:06,082
initiative against Black sking. I like rook takes V six. I feel like this contains

99
00:06:06,172 --> 00:06:09,862
a lot more pizazz because it sets up a potential discovery

100
00:06:10,012 --> 00:06:13,277
and we'll be able to win the E five pond when

101
00:06:13,295 --> 00:06:15,977
we want. So that pond on e five is a sitting duck. We can get

102
00:06:15,995 --> 00:06:18,017
our Night out to have to be later. I don't think we'll have a problem

103
00:06:18,065 --> 00:06:22,342
winning that pond. I think we need to put the emphasis on quick development

104
00:06:22,402 --> 00:06:26,252
and see how far that can get us. Okay. Queen takes b. Three.

105
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:29,822
Our opponent continues to play this pretty accurately. A six, B three,

106
00:06:29,855 --> 00:06:33,152
and kingdom is correct also. Okay, so we need to get our knight out

107
00:06:33,170 --> 00:06:36,602
to f three. And now after nine C six, black is actually holding the

108
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:40,387
balance pretty nicely. So let's complete our development. Let's castle,

109
00:06:40,537 --> 00:06:44,477
and let's continue trying to put pressure on Black in this end

110
00:06:44,495 --> 00:06:48,122
game. I'm very impressed with our opponent's defensive capabilities here.

111
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:51,602
Maybe we should have taken with the bishop after all. But something tells me that

112
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:54,892
this position is very, very hard to play for Black. We have a rook that's

113
00:06:54,952 --> 00:06:58,492
sandwiched on D six, and we need to keep the attack going. We cannot

114
00:06:58,627 --> 00:07:01,922
waste time, and we cannot let Black keep consolidating. So what move

115
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:05,372
allows us to keep the initiative going? This is a very natural move

116
00:07:05,405 --> 00:07:08,602
to me because it creates a lot more threats.

117
00:07:08,632 --> 00:07:12,237
And that moves night out to G five. Exactly. So the knight

118
00:07:14,162 --> 00:07:17,175
can potentially maneuver to e six. It can also

119
00:07:17,762 --> 00:07:21,167
go to f seven. I mean, there's a lot of options here. Rook d eight.

120
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:25,127
So here are very important to avoid taking on D eight. You might think,

121
00:07:25,145 --> 00:07:27,577
oh, we take on D eight and then go night f seven of the fork.

122
00:07:27,682 --> 00:07:30,902
But after rook takes d eight, black and take back with a knight, then we

123
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:33,827
won't be able to get our knight into f seven. So the way we want

124
00:07:33,845 --> 00:07:37,172
to play this is to go with the immediate night f

125
00:07:37,205 --> 00:07:40,697
seven. Now, this isn't exactly a fork because obviously black

126
00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:43,997
plays rook takes six. Now, interesting question.

127
00:07:44,105 --> 00:07:48,075
What do we recapture with this is actually a very tricky question

128
00:07:48,512 --> 00:07:52,172
because I feel like some of you might intuitively gravitate toward taking

129
00:07:52,205 --> 00:07:55,472
with the bishop because it keeps the attack on the rook on H

130
00:07:55,505 --> 00:07:58,667
eight. But if you calculate that out, bishop takes D six,

131
00:07:58,790 --> 00:08:02,447
black plays rook G eight, and yes, we win the pawn on E five.

132
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:06,167
But you have to remember that in the end game, an extra pawn isn't always

133
00:08:06,215 --> 00:08:08,657
the end of the world. And what's going to end up happening is that you

134
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:12,152
get an opposite colored bishop endgame where Black is able to get his

135
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:15,472
pieces out. A much better option is to take with the knight for two reasons.

136
00:08:15,517 --> 00:08:19,082
First of all, this is a fork, so we still are able to win a

137
00:08:19,085 --> 00:08:22,892
pawn. But the most important reason is that we paved the way for

138
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:26,327
the rook to infiltrate to F seven, which is exactly what we're going

139
00:08:26,345 --> 00:08:29,372
to do right now. And we're going to end up winning a lot more than

140
00:08:29,405 --> 00:08:32,512
just one pawn. We're probably going to end up winning two pawns,

141
00:08:32,587 --> 00:08:36,452
and we're going to get a huge attack against Black king. So which pawn do

142
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:39,977
we take first? Well, if you compare, we can take b seven with

143
00:08:39,995 --> 00:08:43,442
the rook, or we can take G seven with the rook. Well,

144
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:46,327
think about it. Obviously we should take G seven with the rook because that attacks

145
00:08:46,357 --> 00:08:49,927
the bishop. And then we can take B seven with the knight

146
00:08:50,032 --> 00:08:53,447
in order to prevent Black from putting his rook on f eight. Notice what Black

147
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:56,522
just did there? He's trying to checkmate us on f one. That's a tricky idea,

148
00:08:56,630 --> 00:08:59,562
but our bishop is preventing the rook from coming to FA.

149
00:09:00,437 --> 00:09:03,797
So now knight takes B seven. We've got our own mating ideas. Knight C five

150
00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:07,217
is very, very close to mate, so we should be able to finish

151
00:09:07,265 --> 00:09:11,252
this one off pretty smoothly. That Night on C six has also

152
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:15,287
lost its supporting pawn. So the move rook C seven could

153
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:18,902
end up being very, very strong. The Night simply doesn't have

154
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:21,932
a lot of breathing room or squares to go to.

155
00:09:22,085 --> 00:09:25,247
Does that make sense? So Black is down

156
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:28,402
two ponds, and we've got the king fully surrounded

157
00:09:28,507 --> 00:09:31,882
king F six. And as we discussed, where should the rook

158
00:09:31,897 --> 00:09:35,027
go? Well, there's only one square available to the rook, and it's C seven,

159
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:38,612
right? It's literally the only move. Literally the only move.

160
00:09:38,675 --> 00:09:42,612
Every other square is controlled by Blacks pieces. D seven is controlled by the bishop.

161
00:09:43,862 --> 00:09:47,297
And now knight D eight loses on the spot. I won't tell you why just

162
00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:50,867
yet in case he plays it. Knight B

163
00:09:50,915 --> 00:09:54,287
eight is probably the only move for blackened. Okay?

164
00:09:54,350 --> 00:09:58,137
Our opponent finds it now in such positions.

165
00:09:58,562 --> 00:10:02,647
On the one hand, you have to play aggressively

166
00:10:02,692 --> 00:10:06,347
and actively, but on the other hand, it's important not to rush too

167
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:09,677
much and to make improving moves when possible so that we

168
00:10:09,695 --> 00:10:12,662
don't have to worry about various headaches. So this is a good example,

169
00:10:12,725 --> 00:10:16,097
right? The king on G one, black has this constant idea of putting

170
00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:18,677
a rook on up one and checkmating us I don't want to deal with that

171
00:10:18,695 --> 00:10:21,977
headache, particularly in time pressure. So one thing we could do to improve our

172
00:10:21,995 --> 00:10:25,192
position is just get the king to E three, a very safe central

173
00:10:25,252 --> 00:10:28,657
square, and then we could worry about picking up the rest of Black spawns.

174
00:10:28,747 --> 00:10:32,897
So we make our improvements first. This helps us survive time

175
00:10:32,930 --> 00:10:36,482
pressure. Let's go king e three. Forget about everything else, and then we're going

176
00:10:36,485 --> 00:10:39,947
to start worrying about bishop D six and knight back to C five and other

177
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:43,697
moves that aim to win blacks other pawns. This is

178
00:10:43,805 --> 00:10:47,452
a nice example of sort of Russian school chess.

179
00:10:47,482 --> 00:10:51,107
You can call it whatever you want, but it's this idea of not

180
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:54,722
making improvements first before you

181
00:10:54,755 --> 00:10:57,300
barrel into complications. Night, d seven.

182
00:10:57,737 --> 00:11:01,277
Okay, so lots of options here. Lots of options here.

183
00:11:01,295 --> 00:11:04,217
We could go night back to D six and try to go to F seven.

184
00:11:04,265 --> 00:11:07,762
I like the concept of trading nights here since we're up two pawns,

185
00:11:07,837 --> 00:11:11,182
an opposite colored bishop end game doesn't worry me too much. I feel like it's

186
00:11:11,197 --> 00:11:14,792
already going to be totally winning. And we're very likely to win a third

187
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:18,722
pawn because black Scott pawns all over the board. They're all scattered. They're all

188
00:11:18,755 --> 00:11:21,842
weak. We're definitely going to win a third pawn here. Okay. Knight b six.

189
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:25,547
And case in point, we can take a seven. And I'm hoping that black

190
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:29,257
plays rook D eight because we have a really, really pretty tactic if rook

191
00:11:29,272 --> 00:11:32,850
D eight happens. Something tells me, though, that he might play rook C eight.

192
00:11:33,212 --> 00:11:37,492
Okay, so we have a third pawn in the bag. We've got connected passers,

193
00:11:37,552 --> 00:11:40,997
which we can start pushing on the very next move. We can play C four,

194
00:11:41,105 --> 00:11:43,702
and then we can move the night back and just keep pushing the CPA.

195
00:11:43,732 --> 00:11:47,177
That's the simplest plan. Very simple. I mean, it's easy to convert these

196
00:11:47,195 --> 00:11:50,602
endgame, so if you don't blunder, anything goes. Work a eight. I mean, that plays

197
00:11:50,632 --> 00:11:54,422
right into our hands. At this point, we're up three pawns, and we're actually even

198
00:11:54,455 --> 00:11:57,452
going to be up four. If you think about it, the E five pawn is

199
00:11:57,470 --> 00:12:01,252
a total sitting dark. How can we combine our bishop and knight

200
00:12:01,357 --> 00:12:04,772
in order to win the E five pond? What two moves can we make in

201
00:12:04,805 --> 00:12:07,967
order to go up four pawns? Yes. We can start with 93,

202
00:12:08,015 --> 00:12:11,025
not 97, because the bishop is covering that square.

203
00:12:11,762 --> 00:12:15,422
Don't forget about these. And now Bishop D six. And now we're up four

204
00:12:15,455 --> 00:12:16,875
pawns and the game is over.

205
00:12:18,887 --> 00:12:22,367
97 would have hung the night. Okay, bishop 65.

206
00:12:22,415 --> 00:12:25,697
Check. And that's it. Now we start

207
00:12:25,730 --> 00:12:29,102
pushing our pawns in no particular order. It doesn't really matter. I would even bring

208
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:32,702
the king up to D four just to help supervise the

209
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:35,822
progress of the pawns. And then we can continue pushing C.

210
00:12:35,930 --> 00:12:39,317
We can push indiscriminately. All of our pieces are defending each other.

211
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:42,300
We really don't have to worry about anything else.

212
00:12:43,562 --> 00:12:46,802
Just keep pushing. B five. C five, c four. The only thing is, Bishop B

213
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:50,077
two might happen, and then we're going to have to move our Bishop. But that's

214
00:12:50,107 --> 00:12:54,377
the only threat that Black can make. Okay, c five and

215
00:12:54,395 --> 00:12:57,437
then C six. And then b. Six. Okay.

216
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:00,450
This is pretty easy and pretty fun.

217
00:13:01,187 --> 00:13:04,322
Thank you, Burritos Galore. Okay, knight takes C five. Check. And now we're also

218
00:13:04,355 --> 00:13:08,222
winning the Bishop on top of everything else. That was a nice game.

219
00:13:08,255 --> 00:13:11,357
That was not easy at all. And our opponent defended very, very well.

220
00:13:11,435 --> 00:13:15,472
So I'm sure that I probably had more efficient

221
00:13:15,517 --> 00:13:19,232
ways to win right out of the opening. But we can take a

222
00:13:19,235 --> 00:13:21,722
look with an engine. Actually, we can take a look with an engine just because

223
00:13:21,755 --> 00:13:24,872
this game in particular, I feel like there was a lot of

224
00:13:24,905 --> 00:13:28,307
tactical action, and it would be a

225
00:13:28,310 --> 00:13:31,427
good idea to see where I went wrong. I'm sure I made quite a few

226
00:13:31,445 --> 00:13:35,227
mistakes and didn't exploit this in the best way. So let's

227
00:13:35,257 --> 00:13:38,432
see. Okay, the accuracy is not bad.

228
00:13:38,585 --> 00:13:41,775
Maybe it wasn't as bad as I had thought.

229
00:13:42,437 --> 00:13:44,250
Okay, so let's see.

230
00:13:45,512 --> 00:13:48,237
So, yeah, e five is a big mistake.

231
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:53,177
I don't know why. It's like not giving me the kind of

232
00:13:53,195 --> 00:13:56,822
review that I want. Okay, anyways, so queen B

233
00:13:56,855 --> 00:14:00,017
three is one of the top moves. I wanted

234
00:14:00,065 --> 00:14:03,347
to show why Bishop takes F seven check is wrong.

235
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:06,527
This is a very instructive moment, and I can already tell by the

236
00:14:06,545 --> 00:14:09,977
email bar that it's wrong. So I've shut down the computer lines for the time

237
00:14:09,995 --> 00:14:13,252
being because I want people to think of this on their own. Okay, so queen

238
00:14:13,282 --> 00:14:16,547
b three. Check. Now, the way you might be thinking of this is, okay,

239
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:19,777
the King moves away. We take on before we've restored

240
00:14:19,807 --> 00:14:23,252
material equality. The King has lost castling rights. We have all of

241
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:27,452
the advantages of our position, but in this position,

242
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:30,967
black has a really cool resource. And if you were listening carefully,

243
00:14:31,027 --> 00:14:34,652
I actually mentioned it during the game, black can play the move D

244
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:38,782
five. And the way that this works is what? White has to waste a tempo

245
00:14:38,872 --> 00:14:42,062
recapturing Bishop because we sacrificed it. And while

246
00:14:42,125 --> 00:14:45,257
we do that, black pushes this pawn down to D four.

247
00:14:45,335 --> 00:14:49,507
Maybe. Actually, black starts with NC. Six. If we look at the computer revolt.

248
00:14:49,597 --> 00:14:53,302
Yeah, NC six is a much better idea here, developing with tempo.

249
00:14:53,332 --> 00:14:56,627
And if the queen drops back to B three, trying to pin the pond in

250
00:14:56,645 --> 00:15:00,302
Black as night, d four. So all of a sudden, Black gets this initiative because

251
00:15:00,395 --> 00:15:03,847
we had to waste time capturing Bishop. So this very concrete tactical

252
00:15:03,892 --> 00:15:07,232
reason actually means that Bishop takes F seven is a

253
00:15:07,235 --> 00:15:10,657
bad move. And Queen D three is correct, as you can see. Okay, so bishop

254
00:15:10,672 --> 00:15:14,402
c? Three, B-C-N-F six. And, yeah, this is completely winning. So bishop B three,

255
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:17,475
check. D. Knight takes C four.

256
00:15:17,837 --> 00:15:21,092
And here we didn't find the correct idea.

257
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:25,042
F three is a pretty significant mistake. It's still winning.

258
00:15:25,177 --> 00:15:29,297
The best move, though, was bishop back to D five.

259
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:33,272
Okay, so here's what I missed. I completely forgot that we're also attacking B

260
00:15:33,305 --> 00:15:36,952
seven. I just forgot that that pawn is hanging. I forgot that pawn

261
00:15:36,982 --> 00:15:40,267
is saying the reason I rejected bishop B five is because it blocks the rooks

262
00:15:40,327 --> 00:15:43,817
contact with the D six pawn. And I didn't realize that, for example,

263
00:15:43,865 --> 00:15:47,702
in this line, bishop C five, DC. And then bishop takes B seven wins the

264
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:51,382
game because it's an attack on the queen and an attack on the rook.

265
00:15:51,547 --> 00:15:54,767
I just forgot about the B seven pawn. This just shows you how important

266
00:15:54,815 --> 00:15:58,202
it is not to be narrow minded when you're attacking and

267
00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:01,397
to pay attention to all potential pressure points in the position.

268
00:16:01,505 --> 00:16:04,697
So bishop D five is one winning move. The other is the same idea.

269
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:08,002
Bishop h five. And then bishop F three, again skewering the knight

270
00:16:08,032 --> 00:16:11,852
in the B seven pawn. So this B seven pawn is quite pivotal to the

271
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:15,122
correct winning path. Bishop B five is a really nice move.

272
00:16:15,155 --> 00:16:19,187
It's very clinical, very surgical. So f three

273
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:22,517
queen h queen f six.

274
00:16:22,715 --> 00:16:26,147
And again, F 64 mistake. At this

275
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:29,722
point, I had already kind of settled on this end game, and this actually loses

276
00:16:29,767 --> 00:16:33,707
most of white's advantage. So not a good job converting this by me.

277
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:36,977
Again, we should have gone to shifty five. But again, I had forgotten about the

278
00:16:36,995 --> 00:16:40,147
b seven pun. I wasn't looking at it. This just shows you that tunnel vision

279
00:16:40,192 --> 00:16:43,997
happens at my level as well. I completely tunnel vision this position. I wasn't even

280
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:47,477
looking at this pond. I forgot that the queen was making contact with it.

281
00:16:47,570 --> 00:16:51,437
And the other winning move is bishop H five. And if knight C five

282
00:16:51,575 --> 00:16:56,042
oh, my goodness. Rook takes D six. Look at that tactic. What a move.

283
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:59,597
Knight takes me through rook D eight is checkmate. Queen Takes

284
00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:03,017
d six. Queen f seven is checkmate. So the

285
00:17:03,065 --> 00:17:06,312
position had a lot more tactical potential than I had realized.

286
00:17:07,187 --> 00:17:10,307
And this is bishop h five is winning on

287
00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:13,667
the spot. Black has to give up the knight, and it's over.

288
00:17:13,865 --> 00:17:17,752
And by the way, folks, knight takes G three doesn't

289
00:17:17,782 --> 00:17:21,075
work because the bishop takes V six, and black has to give the queen up.

290
00:17:21,662 --> 00:17:25,652
So very instruct. Just shows you that. I don't know what this shows exactly,

291
00:17:25,745 --> 00:17:29,027
but I had already kind of made up my mind to go

292
00:17:29,045 --> 00:17:31,922
for this end game, and I thought, white is like winning here,

293
00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:34,725
when in fact, it's the advantage is quite small.

294
00:17:35,687 --> 00:17:39,277
The advantage is quite small. Thank you. A voice for the two months. And apparently

295
00:17:39,307 --> 00:17:42,952
the move, the only move to keep a black position under control is king

296
00:17:42,982 --> 00:17:46,727
F seven, which looks completely counterintuitive because it keeps the

297
00:17:46,745 --> 00:17:49,852
king on the F file, which looks counterproductive

298
00:17:49,882 --> 00:17:53,117
because white is going to castle. But the point is, you go rookie eight.

299
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:56,552
And if White Castles, you tuck the king away on G

300
00:17:56,570 --> 00:18:00,122
eight, it's like an artificial castle. And if White plays knight takes C

301
00:18:00,155 --> 00:18:03,307
five. Obviously you can't take because of checkmate.

302
00:18:03,397 --> 00:18:07,322
Bishop H three, rook f two. And Black is

303
00:18:07,355 --> 00:18:10,427
able to get all of his pieces out. Knight c six. Knight takes C

304
00:18:10,445 --> 00:18:13,772
six, rook takes C four. Intermezzo threatening. Rookie one.

305
00:18:13,805 --> 00:18:17,417
Checkmate. This is how computers play. And apparently black equalizes here.

306
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:20,927
So this is obviously one of the dangers of analyzing with an engine is

307
00:18:20,945 --> 00:18:23,672
like, now you think, oh, this was all pretty easy.

308
00:18:23,855 --> 00:18:27,392
I guess nobody's actually thinking that, though. And kingfseven is

309
00:18:27,515 --> 00:18:30,752
not a move I would even expect the GM to play. I was positive that

310
00:18:30,770 --> 00:18:33,832
king E eight is the only move. Yeah, brilliant.

311
00:18:33,847 --> 00:18:37,697
Blind king F seven, rookie eight. All of sudden, Black artificially castles with

312
00:18:37,730 --> 00:18:40,800
no other pieces developed, and Black is just, okay,

313
00:18:41,462 --> 00:18:46,062
so king E eight, nine, F three. And at this point, Black position sucks castles.

314
00:18:46,487 --> 00:18:49,802
Bishop G four, bishop G four is another inaccuracy. This allows the knight to

315
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:53,327
get into G five. And after knight F seven, I think Black never had any

316
00:18:53,345 --> 00:18:56,872
more chances. Takes, takes. And here, I think we played very accurately.

317
00:18:56,917 --> 00:19:00,750
Rookie seven, bishop H three, knight B seven, rook C seven,

318
00:19:01,412 --> 00:19:04,507
king F two. And you notice that king F two is among the top moves.

319
00:19:04,522 --> 00:19:08,852
So the computer also approves of this kind of play. NC five.

320
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:12,525
Yeah, and I think we never really let Black go after that.

321
00:19:13,412 --> 00:19:17,037
Wow, a lot was packed into those 1st 1015 moves.

322
00:19:18,362 --> 00:19:21,087
A lot was packed into the first 1015 moves.

323
00:19:24,137 --> 00:19:27,857
Wait, 98 here. Because of Bishop B. Seven. Check. With a

324
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:31,547
fork. There was a nice tactic a little bit later on

325
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:34,777
when we were already completely winning. I was hoping that Black would go rook

326
00:19:34,807 --> 00:19:38,482
D eight. Can somebody find an elegant

327
00:19:38,572 --> 00:19:42,302
way to win? More material here? Obviously, we can take on age seven, and this

328
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:45,225
is completely winning. There's a cool little trick here.

329
00:19:45,887 --> 00:19:47,175
Who sees it?

330
00:19:49,262 --> 00:19:52,502
Yeah. 96, check. Bishop takes c six. Bishop B.

331
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:56,102
Seven. Check. With a fork. Using both minor pieces to win the

332
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:58,425
rook, that's actually kind of cool.

333
00:20:01,037 --> 00:20:04,292
So the moral of the story is that I made up my mind,

334
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:07,622
which, first of all, don't automatically go for these

335
00:20:07,655 --> 00:20:11,327
kinds of tactics because they can be wrong. In this case, queen B three is

336
00:20:11,345 --> 00:20:14,972
correct. Made up my mind too quickly about going for that

337
00:20:15,005 --> 00:20:18,452
end game rather than evaluating the options and looking at all sides of the

338
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:22,232
board when you're attacking. And the funny thing is, I talk to my students

339
00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:25,627
often about this, this idea that when you're attacking, it's so easy to tunnel

340
00:20:25,657 --> 00:20:28,792
vision one side of the board and to forget

341
00:20:28,852 --> 00:20:32,627
that something on the other side of the board, such as a hanging piece,

342
00:20:32,795 --> 00:20:36,227
could play a very direct role in the

343
00:20:36,245 --> 00:20:39,977
attack. One way or another because obviously the board is interconnected and

344
00:20:39,995 --> 00:20:43,022
I have a good example of one of my games where I was able to

345
00:20:43,205 --> 00:20:46,725
apply that and win. So basically

346
00:20:47,237 --> 00:20:50,357
it's a case of attack on both sides of

347
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:53,507
the board. So I got this attack down the H file. As you can

348
00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:57,302
see, I started pushing my HPA in this position and then

349
00:20:57,320 --> 00:21:00,752
I traded ponds, I opened up the H file and I got my pieces there.

350
00:21:00,770 --> 00:21:04,502
So after king G seven, I did something cool. Who can tell me what

351
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:07,942
is the fastest way of getting a rook to the H file?

352
00:21:08,077 --> 00:21:12,277
This is a very straightforward concept, but just as a little warm up exercise,

353
00:21:12,307 --> 00:21:16,447
and obviously I'm ignoring the E seven pine. I don't give a pun.

354
00:21:16,642 --> 00:21:20,722
The only thing I care about is getting the rook to the H file.

355
00:21:20,917 --> 00:21:24,602
So we take the horsey forcing DC, and now we

356
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:28,537
just go Nd two. Very good. Not bishop d three. Mathematically,

357
00:21:28,612 --> 00:21:32,302
taking the knight is the fastest way because this forces Black to respond.

358
00:21:32,482 --> 00:21:36,047
OK, so we got a rook to H one. So here it's important to

359
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:39,652
resist the urge to give the check because it actually helps Black skin

360
00:21:39,682 --> 00:21:43,277
go where he wants to go anyway. So we get the knight into the attack

361
00:21:43,445 --> 00:21:47,417
and in this position I found a very, very nice tactic that's very directly based

362
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:51,107
on something on the other side of the board. And I'll give you guys a

363
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:55,042
chance to think about this wipe to play and find a crushing

364
00:21:55,177 --> 00:21:58,577
tactical blow on the kingside. There's just not that much that you

365
00:21:58,595 --> 00:22:02,132
can do, which I think helps people out. There's something on the

366
00:22:02,135 --> 00:22:05,597
king side that white can do. It's not e six. E six there's. Bishop takes

367
00:22:05,630 --> 00:22:07,737
E six and black survives.

368
00:22:09,737 --> 00:22:12,450
Yeah, very good. Knight takes g six.

369
00:22:13,187 --> 00:22:17,077
And the point is this, if black plays king

370
00:22:17,107 --> 00:22:20,372
takes G six and this is where the lesson is

371
00:22:20,405 --> 00:22:24,032
applied, we don't meet the king. That's not the point of

372
00:22:24,035 --> 00:22:27,302
the combination. We go queen age five, check. And all of a sudden we

373
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:30,632
play E takes F six, check and whoop, the queen on 85 is hanging and

374
00:22:30,635 --> 00:22:33,742
white wins the queen. So noticing that queen is crucial,

375
00:22:33,802 --> 00:22:36,692
and if black plays knight takes G six, then we give queen H seven,

376
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:39,912
check. And then we take the knight. And we went easily.

377
00:22:40,337 --> 00:22:43,772
So something similar happened in the game. My opponent played b three.

378
00:22:43,955 --> 00:22:47,917
I basically ignored it. I took it and then played queen H five BC.

379
00:22:47,977 --> 00:22:51,997
King takes C two, knight takes C six. And now the sexiest

380
00:22:52,042 --> 00:22:55,277
move of the game. My opponent actually didn't see this for some reason. He was

381
00:22:55,295 --> 00:22:58,802
expecting queen h seven. Check. That's not what I did, though. What did I

382
00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:01,852
do? I played e six check. And he resigned

383
00:23:01,882 --> 00:23:03,825
because the queen is lost on a five.

384
00:23:04,562 --> 00:23:08,147
So the importance of the other side

385
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:09,762
of the board when you're attacking,

386
00:23:11,537 --> 00:23:15,232
it cannot be overstated. So back to the speedrung

387
00:23:15,247 --> 00:23:19,067
game. fullboard vision. And here looking at the pond on B seven was

388
00:23:19,115 --> 00:23:23,117
critical playing Bishop D five, noticing that this pond being hanging is

389
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:26,542
the key to the victory for White. Okay, guys, that concludes

390
00:23:26,602 --> 00:23:30,602
the analysis, and I think that is

391
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:34,427
going to conclude the stream. Hope you enjoyed. See you

392
00:23:34,445 --> 00:23:37,442
guys later. Thank you so much for the support. Thanks for hanging out, everybody.
